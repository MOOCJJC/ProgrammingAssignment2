## This R program defined two functions that create a special matrix object that
## stores its own inversion and contains setter and getter functions to return
## itself or the inversion.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
